

Followed instructions per the prompt and wrote up the 
structure for the index.

Created About and Contact pages.

Included icon img files for phone and email to decorate
(not sure how to center them with the written info)

Included profile photo (currently Nina, may replace with my own
photo), included alt text and height.

BIG NOTE
I opted to make my Resume its own page rather than appear on the
front page. DOWN THE LINE I'd like to include image links to my
different projects.

Contact page - I decided to practice ATTRIBUTES and turn my 
phone and email into links (as well as the icons). Now they can
be clicked and redirect to call or email actions.

Resume page - Formatted my resume, filled it with Lorem Ipsum text.
Looks good, I'm excited to try more customization options down the
line because it's looking super bland atm.

Did a bit of testing on all the links, everything working correctly.
